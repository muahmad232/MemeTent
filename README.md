# MemeTent 🎮😂

**MemeTent** is a fun-packed Java-based game project that brings classic gameplay and modern humor together! It features two retro games — **Brick Breaker** and the iconic **Chrome Dino Game** — but with a twist: interactive memes that react to your performance! The better (or worse) you play, the memes evolve in real-time, giving you instant feedback... with attitude 😎

## 🕹️ Features

* 🔥 **Brick Breaker** — Break bricks while being judged by memes.
* 🦖 **Chrome Dino Clone** — Jump cacti and dodge birds, while memes cheer or roast you.
* 😂 **Dynamic Memes** — "Chippi Chappa" and "Hamaster" memes change based on how well you're playing.
* 💻 **Built with Java** — Easily extendable, readable object-oriented structure.
* 🚀 **Optimized for IntelliJ IDEA** — Run smoothly out of the box in IntelliJ with minimal setup.

## 📷 Meme Requirements

To run the game successfully, make sure you **download the following memes** and place them in the correct resources directory:

* ✅ `chippi.gif` — Used during both games to react to intense gameplay moments.
* ✅ `hamaster.gif` — Shows up depending on your score and performance.

> Make sure the meme files are named *exactly* and placed in the directory same as files.
